#+TITLE: Prelude

* Intro

~hnix-store~ project was founded in 2018 by Shea Levy as a companion
to [[https://github.com/haskell-nix/hnix/][hnix]] project, which is its primary user. It lives its own life
separate from ~hnix~ repository to prevent cross coupling
between the two components which should allow for store to be used
as a standalone interface to [[https://github.com/NixOS/nix][Nix]] stores.
